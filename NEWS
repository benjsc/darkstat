darkstat v3.0.540 and earlier defaulted to running in the foreground
and had a "-d" commandline argument to get darkstat to daemonize,
detach from the controlling terminal, and run in the background.

Since r540, the default has been inverted.  darkstat will daemonize by
default.

Since r626, this behaviour can be suppressed with the "--debug"
commandline argument, to force darkstat to stay in the foreground for
debugging purposes.

The "-d" argument is no longer recognized, and will prevent darkstat
from starting, so make sure you adjust any startup scripts you may have.

After 3.0.708, --debug was split into --verbose and --no-daemon.

Since v3.0.694, darkstat is able to save its internal database into a
file and reload it on startup.  The file format is, by design,
incompatible with the format from darkstat v2.
